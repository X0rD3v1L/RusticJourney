# Rust Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey as I learn Rust.

## What I've Learned

- I've studied the RustBook, which covers the fundamentals of Rust, including ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and more.
- I've applied my knowledge by working on several tiny Rust projects, gaining hands-on experience.


Happy learning and coding with Rust!
