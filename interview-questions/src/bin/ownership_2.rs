/*
Copy trait is designed for types that have a fixed, small size and can be duplicated by simply copying bits.
Examples of such types are primitive types like i32, f32, or arrays like [i32; 4].
These are stored entirely on the stack.

Rust provides the Clone trait for explicitly creating deep copies of heap-allocated data like String.
This avoids confusion and ensures that copying is an explicit action.

fn main() {
    // Ownership with numbers (primitive types)
    let x = 5;  // `x` owns the value 5
    let y = x;  // `y` is a copy of `x`

    // Both `x` and `y` are valid because integers implement the Copy trait
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y); // Both can be used without issues

    // Ownership with heap-allocated numbers (Boxed integers)
    let a = Box::new(10);  // `a` owns the value 10, stored on the heap
    let b = a;             // Ownership is transferred to `b`

    // ‚ùå `a` can no longer be used because ownership is moved
    // println!("a: {}", a); // This would cause a compile-time error
    println!("b: {}", b); // `b` now owns the value
