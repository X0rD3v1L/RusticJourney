These questions summarize those asked during various Rust-based interviews. I will update them periodically.

### **Basics of Rust**  
1. **What is Rust, and where is it mostly used?**  
   - Explain Rust's key features and common use cases.  

2. **What are ownership and borrowing in Rust? Explain with examples.**  
   - Cover the concepts of ownership, borrowing, and references with code snippets.  

3. **What are lifetimes in Rust? Explain with examples.**  
   - Discuss how Rust ensures memory safety with lifetimes, including examples.  

4. **What is the process of how memory is allocated for a `String` type in Rust?**  
   - Walk through the `String` type and its memory allocation on the heap.

### **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**  
5. **What are `async` and `await` in Rust?**  
   - Explain Rust’s approach to asynchronous programming with code examples.  

6. **Explain Tokio and where it is used.**  
   - Discuss the Tokio runtime, its role in async programming, and common use cases.  

7. **What is pinning in Rust, and why is it important?**  
   - Elaborate on the concept of pinning and its significance in async programming.

### **Error Handling and Unsafe Code**  
8. **How do we handle errors in Rust?**  
   - Discuss `Result`, `Option`, `?` operator, and idiomatic error handling.  

9. **What is unsafe Rust? Explain with an example.**  
   - Cover scenarios where unsafe Rust is used and provide sample code.  

---

### **Advanced Concepts**  
10. **What are generics in Rust? Explain with examples.**  
    - Provide examples to demonstrate generics with functions and structs.  

11. **How do you implement inheritance in Rust?**  
    - Explain Rust’s composition-over-inheritance approach using traits.  

---

### **Memory Management and Safety**  
12. **What is the possibility of memory leaks in Rust?**  
    - Discuss cases where memory leaks can occur despite Rust’s ownership model.  

13. **Explain deadlocks concerning Rust.**  
    - Describe how deadlocks can occur in concurrent Rust code and ways to avoid them.
